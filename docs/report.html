  <h1>Unsupervised Machine Learning: MNIST Digits</h1>

  <section id="data-overview">
    <h2>1. Data Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset is readily available within <code>sklearn</code>:
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

mnist = fetch_openml("mnist_784")
X, y = mnist.data, mnist.target.astype(int)
</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>X</code> is a dataframe containing 784 features, each representing a pixel in a 28 × 28 image. 
      There are 70,000 observations (digit images) in the dataset. 
      Below is a visualization of 25 randomly sampled observations.

    <h2>2. Linear Dimension Reduction Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      This section applies, compares, and contrasts <strong>PCA</strong>, <strong>NMF</strong>, and <strong>ICA</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>

    <h3> Observations </h3>
    <p>
      PC1 and PC2 capture latent patterns among digits — some digits (e.g., digit 1) are well separated in this projection.
      Interpreting PC1 and PC2 by examining observations along these directions yields the visualization below.

    </p>

    <h3> Features </h3>
    <p>
      PC2 appears to capture <em>digit thickness</em> — moving from positive to negative PC2, digits become thinner.
      PC1 captures a subtler pattern, possibly related to <em>digit slant</em>.

    <h3> Hyperparameter Tuning </h3>
    The number of principal components (PCs) cannot exceed the number of original features. 
    To determine the optimal number of PCs, we can examine the variance explained using a scree plot and apply the “elbow rule,” 
    or use more quantitative approaches to tune this hyperparameter. 

    Since labels are available, one practical method is to fit a simple multinomial classifier on progressively larger subsets of the principal components 
    and track how classification accuracy changes until it stabilizes. 
    This downstream supervised tuning effectively helps optimize an unsupervised method. 
    Alternatively, we can evaluate the quality of the reduced representation by comparing how well observations in the reduced space preserve relationships 
    from the original space, for example using a Jaccard similarity measure.
    <br><br>
    For PCA, given the analytical closed form, nested, and ordered solution - it makes sense to use supervised optimization. 
    Below I fit 20 mutlinomial classification models on X projected to 5, 10, 15, ..., 100 PCs and evaluate the accuracy of each iteration to inspect convergence.
    </code></pre>

    These results indicate that there is a convergence between 40 to 60 PCs - this appears to be the optimal number of components to use when performing PCA on MNIST dataset.
